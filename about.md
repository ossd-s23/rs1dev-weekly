HI! My name is Riya and I'm currently a senior at NYU majoring in Computer Science. I was born and raised in California but have become quite fond of the East Coast during my college years. I'm excited to graduate this Spring and become a part of the transformative tech industry :). Shoot me a note at *rs6854@nyu.edu*. 

Welcome to my blog for the Open Source Software Development Class with Professor Joanna Klukowska! 

### More Information

* I love to stay active and find new ways to do so such as taking boxing, pilates, or dance classes in the city. But for me nothing beats an outdoor run along the Hudson. 
* I've trekked part of the Himalayan mountain range. 
* I love to dance (contemporary and street style) and listen to music (contemporary/alt R&B and pop).
