title: Week 1, Stepping into Open Source
---


In my computer science experience thus far, I have used many open source tools and programs, but until now, have not contributed to most of them in a significant way. In a psychology class at NYU last year, I did edit a Wikipedia page for a famous patient case study relating to memory as part of an extra credit assignment. Unfortunately, that is the extent to which my contributions go; however, I hope to expand my contributions in the coming months through and beyond this course. 

After learning more about open source and its pervasiveness in the computer science field, I feel even more compelled to take this course and contribute to open source and do my small part to give back to the growing community. 

When I hear the term “open source”, I think about code that is easily and freely accessible to anyone. Usually, these are large programs or libraries with many contributors with their code posted on a platform like Github. As we have learned in class, there are different licenses that must meet specific requirements–as outlined in the [OSD](opensource.org/osd)–and be included in the program for it to be considered open source. These open-source software licenses typically allow for the code to be used, modified, and distributed by anyone.
