## In-Class Git Activity 

I think the git activity we did in class was a good, quick refresher on git and github commands and tools. I've mostly used the GUI on VSCode when I work with a repository on Github. Specifically, commands like stage, commit, pull, create branch, and more can be done via clicking the right icons on the interface. This is convenient, but it has deterred me from using the terminal which is what we did for the in-class activity. Using the terminal and typing out the commands and receiving output on the console was different and slightly more cumbersome than using the IDE. However, it is important to be proficient with the terminal, so I plan to use it more often for coding projects involving git and github. 
I learned some new commands from the activity like 'git remote -v' and 'git status' which I hadn't used directly before but probably used under the hood.  
I think the diagram that Professor drew up on the board was very helpful in visualizing and understanding the structure and workflow of remote and local repositories and how they interact. 

I included a picture ![here](git_diagram.pn) for easy reference.

## Group Browser Extension Project 

My team decided to create an extension that allows users to color-customize their tabs using a pop-up menu with a variety of colors. 
This was the first time anyone from my group worked on a browser extension, so we learned a lot from the web, [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and [MDN Browser Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) from class. We largely based our extension from the [second extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_second_WebExtension) in the tutorial. 

I wrote and edited the readme.md file, created a discord server linked there for anyone to join if interested, and updated the live log after each of our meetings. 
I ran into an issue with the development workflow and accidentally merged my branch that had code I committed in the .js and .json files that I was just experimenting with. In the same branch I also was updating the readme.md file and when I merged the branch with main, I didn't realize it would merge all the changes. I was able to revert this merge and checkout a new branch just for the readme.md changes. This was a good learning moment as I realized the importance of checking all the commits in a branch before merging it with the main branch.

On the coding side, we ran into a bug as we received a browser.theme undefined error when we tried running the extension. We eventually figured out we weren't using the theme.update() function correctly to set the color. After a few iterations of changes to the function, we got the extension to work properly and it felt very rewarding. 

We also initially discussed a potential feature which would be to group tabs with the same color together with an option of opening a new window and moving them there. However, after looking into this more, we realized it is more challenging than we thought and decided to hold off on it for this deadline.

Prior to this course, I have had a decent amount of exposure to git throughout my other computer science classes. Thus, the in-class git exercise was not new information but definitely a useful refresher on git. I am glad that was a part of the curriculum because it helped clarify any lingering confusion I had about git and GitHub.

Git is an incredible tool and fortunately, I've had the privilege of working with it in previous CS courses and frequently at my job. Prior to be introduced to git itself, I didn't quite realize the power of version-contol systems and their increasingly prevalence in day-to-day life. The easiest example is Google Docs, where you can return to any point in a document with ease. Git allows anyone to do the same, and though it is popularized by developers, it has the ability to track changes in all sorts of files.

The in-class git exercises we did were super helpful. As mentioned previously, I have had a fair amount of experience using git, so I was able to follow along fairly well. However, I had not experimented with upstream branches very much, so to see that in action was very interesting.

I thought the examples of different types of merge conflicts was great, as it showed how git can auto-merge some changes and not others. This was my biggest issue when I first started using Git, and I think these exercises would've been super valuable to a beginner.

Overall, it was a great refresher about the concepts of upstreams, remotes, forks, etc.

Although I have used git before and have had experience working with these commands, it has been a while and I appreciate the refresher. I enjoyed the guided activity and it reinforced some of the ideas about version control that have become fuzzy: for example, I haven't used remotes/forks very often so my understanding of the work flow wasn't very clear, but the diagram that professor drew on the board was really helpful visually. Additionally, it was helpful to know these commands for the group project.
