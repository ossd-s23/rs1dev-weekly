## In-Class Git Activity 

I think the git activity we did in class was a good, quick refresher on git and github commands and tools. I've mostly used the GUI on VSCode when I work with a repository on Github. Specifically, commands like stage, commit, pull, create branch, and more can be done via clicking the right icons on the interface. This is convenient, but it has deterred me from using the terminal which is what we did for the in-class activity. Using the terminal and typing out the commands and receiving output on the console was different and slightly more cumbersome than using the IDE. However, it is important to be proficient with the terminal, so I plan to use it more often for coding projects involving git and github. 
I learned some new commands from the activity like 'git remote -v' and 'git status' which I hadn't used directly before but probably used under the hood.  
I think the diagram that Professor drew up on the board was very helpful in visualizing and understanding the structure and workflow of remote and local repositories and how they interact.

## Group Browser Extension Project 

My team decided to create an extension that allows users to color-customize their tabs using a pop-up menu with a variety of colors. 
This was the first time anyone from my group worked on a browser extension, so we learned a lot from the web, [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and [MDN Browser Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) from class. We largely based our extension from the [second extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_second_WebExtension) in the tutorial. 

I wrote and edited the [readme.md](https://github.com/ossd-s23/TabColor/blob/main/README.md) file, created a discord server linked there for anyone to join if interested, and updated the live log on Ed after each of our meetings. 
I ran into an issue with the development workflow and accidentally merged my branch that had code I committed in the .js and .json files that I was just experimenting with. In the same branch I also was updating readme.md and when I merged my branch with the main branch, I didn't realize it would merge all the changes. I was able to revert this merge and checkout a new branch just for the readme.md changes. This was a good learning moment as I realized the importance of checking all the commits in a branch before merging it with the main branch.

On the coding side, we ran into a bug as we received a browser.theme undefined error when we tried running the extension. We eventually figured out we weren't using the theme.update() function correctly to set the color. After a few iterations of changes to the function, we got the extension to work properly and it felt very rewarding. 

We also initially discussed a potential feature which would be to group tabs with the same color together with an option of opening a new window and moving them there. However, after looking into this more, we realized it would be more challenging than we thought and decided to hold off on it for this deadline.
