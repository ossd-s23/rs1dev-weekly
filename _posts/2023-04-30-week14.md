## Open Source And ... 
Two areas where open source is being applied that are particularly interesting to me are in \\ 
- Design, Animation, and Visual Creations 
- Research 

My classmates found some interesting projects in these two domains, which I'm going to delve into here.

### Design, Animation, and Visual Creations 

[Blender](https://www.blender.org) is a popular free and open source software for 3D creations. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline-modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking and video editing. I had first heard about Blender from a friend who is an Industrial Design major at Georgia Tech. She had tinkered with it for a project but said it wasn't the best for what she usually works on because it doesn't have great scaling. She also pointed me to the infamous [donut tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw) on Youtube to get started. The tutorial seems like a great way to get started with Blender and learn the basics of the software. The creator said within the first 30 seconds: "If you’ve just opened Blender for the first time, and you’ve tried to do things; maybe tried to see how far you can go without getting help {insert patronizing laugh}, you might’ve discovered you need help immediately. You can’t even move things without a tutorial..." I think when I have some more free time, I'll probably try it out a bit more. My hunch is that I'll be more involved as a user than developer for this project, at least for now, since the learning curve is pretty steep. I was really impressed with the short movie they put out called *[Charge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqq0ZvbOnk)* which used accessible production files and assets from [Blender Studio](https://studio.blender.org/welcome/), a dedicated team of artists, creators, and developers challenging themselves with creative-technical targets to help Blender users and to drive Blender development forward. 

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) and [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) are two other program for illustrators and designers which are alternatives to paid softwares like the Adobe Suite. This helps democratize digital graphic design and allow anyone to harness their creativity. A list of features supported by Inkscape can be found [here](https://inkscape.org/about/features/), and the offer most of the same features as Adobe Illustrator. Krita is more for 2d animation, so it could be a first step for anyone trying to get into digital art and graphic design. 

### Research 

[Open Science Foundation](https://osf.io) is a free, open platform to support research and enable collaboration. Papers, data, and materials fo research projects can be found there, and it can store data and code in the OSF Storage cloud. I think research can definitely benefit from this because from what I've heard and my experience, data collection and reproduciple data pipelines are often an obstacle in computer science research. 

[PsycoPy](https://psychopy.org/index.html) is a free cross-platform package to run a wide range of dynamic, interactive experiments in the behavioral sciences. It is also being used by universities for teaching students about experiments!
