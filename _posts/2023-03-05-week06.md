## Exploring Different Open-Source Projects 

Since completing the browser extension project, we've been plunging into large-scale open-source projects and communities. We first worked in groups on the project evaluation [activity](https://github.com/ossd-s23/project-evaluation/blob/main/template_evaluation.md) to evaluate an assigned open-source project. 
My group was assigned Hadoop and [this](https://github.com/ossd-s23/project-evaluation/blob/main/hadoop_evaluation.md) is the evaluation doc we produced. I learned a lot more about Hadoop and its features, which I think was a cool bonus. However, after completing the questions in the activity, it became clear that contributing to this project would be quite challenging and wouldn't be very friendly for beginners. In short, the reasons we concluded this were the following: hardware and architecture omplexity such as 500GB of available storage for data nodes (my computer only has 250GB max) and solid-state drivers (SSDs) :clown_face:, a cluster of servers which _may_ be available through the NYU High-Performance Computing lab but still :grimacing:, and an understanding of distributed, computational models such as MapReduce. 
On the individual exploration part, I did find some open-source projects that are more appropriate for beginners: MuseScore, OpenFoodFacts, and OpenLibrary. 


## I'm Excited About... 
Music has had a transformative role in my life and has been with me through the good, bad, and the ugly. I love it because it is such an expansive field and there is always new things to learn and discover. I've always been an avid listener of music(ever since I got a Spotify (premium——aka no ads :parking:) account), and first came into my life as a young dancer.  I’ve recently gotten into music tech and production and am teaching myself how to use a DAW, play the piano, and read sheet music. I'm also taking a private voice class here at NYU in my final semester. So, ya, I'm a bit of a music nerd. 

One open-source project that really caught my attention is MuseScore. I've used MuseScore, specifically, [MuseScore.com](https://musescore.com) to find sheet music for singing and learning piano. I downloaded the iOS and macOS app versions and have interacted with them fairly extensively. When I was looking for open-source projects one of the fields I looked into, unsurprisingly, was music. I discovered [muse group](https://mu.se) which is the parent company of many softwares and communities for musicians such as Ultimate Guitar, Audacity, MuseClass, and MuseScore. [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) and [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) are both proudly open source. 

A cool timeline for[muse group](https://mu.se)'s history can be found [here](https://mu.se/about). 

I looked mainly into MuseScore and think it would be a great fit for me for the following reasons: it's in the music domain which I <3, it has a good set of beginner-friendly issues, it has an active and engaging community through Discord and Twitter.
